        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><em>Hello, I'm Sammy Alia</em>. I am a passionate and driven individual with a
             deep love for technology and creativity. My journey in the world of coding and development 
             began at a young age, and I've been exploring the vast landscape of programming ever since.
              I believe in the power of innovation to make a positive impact on the world.</p>


        <p><em> Some sports I love playing are basketball,football and <abbr title="Mixed Martial Arts">MMA</abbr> . My favourite
             season is the fall because the vibes often give me a nostolgic feeling. I tend
              the find the beauty in simplicity. I enjoy mango and watermlon as well as frosted
               flakes cerial for breakfast. </em>  </p>
